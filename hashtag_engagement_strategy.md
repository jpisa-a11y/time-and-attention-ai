## 🏷️ HASHTAG STRATEGY

### Core Brand Hashtags (Use in Every Post)
These hashtags define the Time & Attention brand and should appear in every post across all platforms:

**Primary Hashtags:**
- `#TimeAndAttention` - Brand identifier
- `#FinancialLiteracy` - Core mission
- `#FailForward` - Philosophy
- `#FinancialWellness` - Outcome

**Why These Work:** They're specific enough to build community, broad enough to reach new audiences, and directly aligned with the brand mission.
